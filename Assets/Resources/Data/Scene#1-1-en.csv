*	Glos	핀토스 공작가1
*	Tutorial	Glossary

yeong	-	No suspicious moves so far. 	
yeong	-	Enemy is everywhere as long as the Haskells are present. ^We should always remain alert and check for anyone suspicious. 	
eren	-	They are fettered to their reputation, ^so the scenario of their wielding swords and slaying us at this Royal Ballroom is improbable. 	
*	Glos	영1
*	Glos	에렌 오블리비언1
reina	-	It is a rare occation, so why don't you blend into other people ^of the <color=red>Pintos</color> clan? ^You will be working with these knights anyways.

blank	-	With Hands modestly folded and a graceful bow, ^Kashasty have greeted Reina with an unusually formal attitude.	
reina	-	You don't have to be this formal in front of me. ^Only in front of the Emperor is your formalness necessary, isn't it? 	
kashasty	-	This is a factitious fashion of mine, an heritage of Lovelace. ^Maintenance of sharpness in an immaculate performance is critical.	
kashasty	-	Any slight circumstance of discourtesy in presence of his majesty is intolerable, as it may disrepute your highness.	
blank	-	Conscious speech and gesture of Kashasty must have called her trauma of her enslaved past.

*	Glos	트리아나 페르단트1
blank	-	Turning towards the source of the line, <color=red>another knight</color> was standing at the back, shoulders timidly shrunk and her back slightly bent.

blank	-	Traumatized by a terrible incident before serving the Pintoses, Triana is always intimidated.^Will he be ever able to overcome his trauma? 	
reina	-	Nothing in particular now, thank you. 	
aron	-	What is that outfit, at this formal occation? You truly are a black sheep of the family.	
aron	-	You shouldn't have brought that fopdoodle into the Knights of Pintos. Chickens of a feather flocking together? 	
reina	irritated	……Keep your mouth shut. I don't care about our fragile relationship, ^but at the very least don't expose that in front of their eyes. 	
*	Glos	아론1
blank	-	Turning herself away from her idiotic <color=red>cousin</color>, Reina looked at the Haskell's side. ^They seemed to be having conversations by themselves, paying little attention to the Pintoses. 	
reina	-	(Sigh…… it's his majesty who made us to this ball, ^but at least sounding them out is meaningful than wasting time waiting for His presence.)

blank	-	As I approached the Haskells, their speech diminished.

*	Glos	루키어스 하스켈1	
reina	-	Long time no see, the <color=red>Duke of Haskell</color>.	
blank	-	The smile I sent as a courtesy was littered to the ground and shattered into pieces at once. 	
lucius	-	No words of greetings are prepared for a murderer. 	
blank	-	Well, if he is not ready for a civilized conversation, I have no reason at all to remain polite.	
reina	-	Hmm, I have no idea what you are talking about, but your manner will embarrass his majesty, who have provided us a table for conversations.

*	Glos	친위국1	
kashasty	-	Navy uniform…… you must be from <color=red>Aster</color>. What is the task that has brought you here?	
bianca	-	No excuses nor lies, rebels! We know everything!	
lucius	-	……oh, the investigation is over, I assume? 	
blank	-	Lucius, nodding, seemed to be the only one who seemed to understand what was going on.	
reina	-	(Was there something going behind my back?!)	
lucius	-	Summoning us the Haskells in order to catch them off guard, ^his majesty truly plans everything thoroughly.	
lucius	-	Reina Pintos.^The judgment of justice is finally upon you. 	
reina	-	Judgment, what are you talking about……!	
luvericha	-	Ahh, truly blessed we are, my brother.	
luvericha	-	Let us make our exeunt and leave the stage to the Stars of the Empire.

blank	-	Their top priority seemed to be the head of the family, which is me.	
blank	-	I defeated a few flocks of the enemy and made my way to the garden,^but the corridor leading out was packed with enemies.	
*	SE	Bomb
triana	-	Get lost! Leave me aloneeeee--------!!!

reina	-	(I cannot care about other people now. Okay, maybe now is the chance……)	
lucius	-	Duchess of Pintos?!	
blank	-	I turned around towards the call,^ only to find the one who hates me the most.	
reina	-	(I don't care about him,^but staying here will make my life at risk.)	
lucius	-	…….	
blank	-	He must have got here the same way I did. ^He was holding a sword from the Royal army, must be a loot.	
reina	-	(His combat skill is definitely unquestionable.^If used wisely, I shall make my way out of here?)	
blank	-	Lucius will not be easily persuaded, but I have few other options.	
reina	-	It seems like breaking through by force is the only option. 	
reina	-	Some troop has just withdrawn and now is the chance.^We never know when they will be back so let's be quick. Lead front, I will do my best to assist you. 	
lucius	-	…….	
blank	-	He stared at me for a minute and brusquely replied. 	
lucius	-	Do you think I am willing to help you? To help my brother's murderer?	
blank	-	Speaking nonsense at this fatal moment, I became speechless and anger rose in me.	
reina	-	……Don't mess with me.

reina	-	Grow up! We have no time! ^I have to fulfill my duty as the head of the Pintoses.

reina	-	……!

soldier	-	There comes the sound!	
lucius	-	……That's right. There must be those I have to protect.
