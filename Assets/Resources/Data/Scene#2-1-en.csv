noel	-	Mission failed.
blank	-	Not only have we missed many of them, ^but also, our main goal, to seize Lucius Haskell and Reina Pintos, has failed.
sepia	-	……It is undeniable that the operation ended up as a terrible failure.^There can be no excuse.
arcadia	-	It is fortunate to capture a spySword resource, though.
darkenir	-	Underestimation has contributed to our failure. We could not take the possibility of their escape with only two persons into consideration. 
grenev	-	Hmph, that's because of the long-lasting peace. You all went dull after idling around.
bianca	shout	Still! How can we end up capturing only a few,^with all those forces and preparation and ambush?!
noel	-	(……Headache again.^My stamina is no longer like before, this may be a sign of my aging.)
noel	-	Analyzing attributes is important, but we have not gathered here for such purpose.
*	Glos	집행관1	
bianca	yell	Yes!! Of course!^Then, what shall we <color=red>Executors</color> do?
noel	-	An investigation shall begin on the estate of Pintos tomorrow.^The goal is to acquire the body of Monad his majesty.
noel	-	It is at their home ground. Make sure that you are fully prepared.
sepia	-	Your wish shall have every attention of ours.
noel	-	The emperor his majesty has also ordered to capture those escaped…….
bianca	yell	Me! I'll go! I am going! Rapid movements and tracking traces are my specialities!
darkenir	-	That sure is reasonable…… but will one person be sufficient for the job?
darkenir	-	Failures must be fully analyzed and reflections must be applied for the next move. Fangs of foes are sharper than our prediction.
bianca	smile	They are injured escapees! Plus, their numbers are few.
json	-	Don't forget that your forces are weighted towards tracking and support.^If you find the target, it would be better to contact nearby forces for a joint attack.
blank	-	Though usually speechless, he has advised Bianca at the right time.^Now we don't have to further persuade her.
darkenir	-	The idea is sure brilliant. That will be sufficient. 
noel	-	Our current priority is to incapacitate their leaders,^Lucius Haskell and Reina Pintos.
noel	-	The remaining forces will collapse naturally without leaders.
arcadia	-	If they split their ways, Bianca will not be able to chase down both Then.
arcadia	-	Even if they are together, it will be tough for Bianca's forces to defeat them both.
sepia	-	Which means that at least one more person should join the mission:^one responsible for Reina Pintos, and the other for Lucius Haskell.
json	-	……I will participate in the mission.

noel	-	<color=red>You</color>?
blank	-	It is rare of him to show his enthusiasm. It is a good news for an administrator, nonetheless.
noel	-	Then, I shall report the participants to the Director.^You shall start preparing for your mission, Bianca and Jason.

noel	-	(Haskell, Pintos…… Losing everything upon greed over more power despite their wealth, how foolish one's desire can be.)
blank	-	Bianca and Jason have led their troops to the tracking mission,^and the rest of the Headquarters have arrived at the Pintos estate to retrieve the body of Monad.
noel	-	(Shall eternal peace brought onto this world, my God.)
darkenir	-	Final check complete, everything is ready.
noel	-	Capture the servants rather than kill.^However, summary conviction is allowed on those who resist.
blank	-	Sacrifice should be minimized, no matter which side.^However, the Executors and agents' safety should be the top priority.
grenev	-	Mission understood!

blank	-	Stepping into the mansion with the signal,^a whispering voice stirred Noel's head.
*	SE	Whisper	
?monad	-	(You, seem to possess special powers.)
noel	surprised	Who is that!
?monad	-	(The mundanes are not allowed to hear my voice.)
darkenir	-	What has happened?
noel	-	……nothing, nothing.

?monad	-	(Power so strong to block my manipulation…… an authorized on to negotiate with me on equal terms.)
?monad	-	(Your power should have been mine. You shall devote your power to my hand, and in return your grants shall flourish.)
*	SE	Whisper
?monad	-	(You shall defeat senility, you shall remain strong, you shall gain brightness to know everything.)
*	Glos	신성력1	
noel	-	(Special power? You mean <color=red>the Power of God</color>?)
?monad	-	(Power of God……? Ah, yes. That's what Aquinas' fraud have said.)
noel	-	(How dare you blaspheme Apostle Aquinas.)
?monad	-	(His gibberish still holds validity after five hundred years?^Hah, I should have uprooted his cult.)
noel	-	(……being an arrogant heretic, who are you?)
monad	-	(Monad is my name, the name with the power which you call "the Power of God".)
noel	surprised	(Monad?! You?)
monad	-	(Come to the underground dungeon, where what you seek lies silent.)
blank	-	Is he the founder of this Empire, now distorted by evil experiments of rebels, who have remained in this world for five hundred years?
noel	-	(……I must refuse. Now, requiescat in pace. )
monad	-	(Ridiculous.)
*	SE	Whisper	
blank	-	That was his final word.

blank	-	At the same time, the maids drew out their weapons and started advancing towards the Executors.
