triana	-	…….
blank	-	I have always been wondering how could he maintain his position in the duchy despite doing nothing. His hidden power, when we were all in danger, has slain all the enemies surrounding us. 	
blank	-	That has disrupted the siege and we managed to stay alive. 
yeong	-	(Well, I managed to drag him out of the chaos…….)
blank	-	He indeed is a weird guy, but staying with him is way better than with other people.^At least he neither condemns nor orders me. 
blank	-	The problem is something else.
yeong	-	Stay sharp, we are fugitives now.
yeong	-	(Is he even conscious about our current situation? This definitely does not help.)
blank	-	I grabbed his arm and pulled him, dragging him forward. ^His steps were irregular, as if he is letting his feet move by themselves.	
*	Glos	루아 왕국1
yeong	-	Staying in Unity is dangerous, so we have to leave as soon as possible. ^I guess we have to head east, to either Java or<color=red>Lua</color>.	
blank	-	He is not responding to any of my words. 
yeong	-	Are you listening? 
*	BGM	BGM_Urgent
*	SE	FireBall
blank	-	A red halo spurt out of his right arm all of a sudden, ^its shape resembling what I saw at the banquet. 	
*	SE	Bomb	
*	Quake
blank	-	Almost involuntarily I lowered my head, and the red light struck a bush near us. 
blank	-	The bush was torn into pieces, and the ambush hiding behind it quickly surrouned us.
eichmann	에히만	Hmph, your senses are sure sharp, but don't expect to get away this time! 
*	SE	PullSword
blank	-	I pulled out my sword immediately and put on full alert. 
yeong	-	Shi……!
json	-	……proceed.	
blank	-	With the commander's sign the enemies flew at us in perfect order.
